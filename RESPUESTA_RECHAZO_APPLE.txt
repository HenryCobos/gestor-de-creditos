Dear App Review Team,

Thank you for your feedback on submission 4cef7ed5-2317-43d1-b5df-1fbc8822fae7.

We have carefully reviewed your feedback and made all necessary corrections. This new build (156) addresses both issues:

GUIDELINE 3.1.2 - SUBSCRIPTIONS - FREE TRIAL DISCLOSURE:
✅ FIXED - Our subscription flow now clearly shows:
• Trial button text: "Start FREE 3-day trial" (duration is clear)
• Disclosure text below button: "After the 3-day free trial period, you will be automatically charged [PRICE]/month. Cancel anytime before the trial ends to avoid charges."
• Price displayed in user's local currency (USD, PEN, MXN, COP, etc.)
• All information visible without additional scrolling

Files updated:
- src/components/paywall/SimplePaywall.tsx
- src/components/paywall/ContextualPaywall.tsx

GUIDELINE 4.1 - DESIGN - COPYCATS:
✅ FIXED - App name changed to avoid any confusion:
• Previous name: "PrestaMax - Préstamos"
• New name: "Gestor de Créditos" (Generic "Credit Manager" in Spanish)

We confirm:
- No relationship with any third-party brands
- Name is purely descriptive and generic
- No trademark infringement

File updated:
- app.json (name and description)

ADDITIONAL IMPROVEMENTS IN THIS BUILD:
• Partial payment system (users can pay any amount)
• Support for late payments without restrictions  
• Automatic loan completion when all installments are paid
• Bug fixes and performance improvements

All changes have been tested and comply with Apple's guidelines.

We appreciate your time reviewing our app and hope these corrections meet your requirements.

Thank you,
